# DeprovisionIntelAMT
Script is based on the following Intel Advisory : 
https://security-center.intel.com/advisory.aspx?intelid=INTEL-SA-00075&languageid=en-fr
And on this blog post.
Please note you will need to download the intel ACU tool and place it in your LTshare.

I also included the very basic search to find machines with AMT enabled. Now for the joke, you actually need to look for IntelVpro is true as there is a bug in the search... This bug has been submitted to Labtech and found by Darren White ;)
